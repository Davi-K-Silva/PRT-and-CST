# PRT-and-CST
Two Tree variant structures made to count nodes that distributed a natural value equaly, Pointer Regression Tree and Counter Segment Tree.

## How to use
### Specific test:
You can run a specific test file by using `$ java Test.java <Tree Type> <File.txt>`.
Where `<Tree Type>` can be "**prt**" or "**cst**".

Example: `$ java Test.java prt teste5.txt` (This aplies teste5.txt inputs into a PRTree).

### All tests:
You can run all test files by passing the argument "**all**" in the end of the comand.

Example: `$ java Test.java cst all` (This is goint to tun all test files inside "testCase" folder into a CSTree).

**P.S:** when using this argument execution time will not be used to Java JVM limitations when it comes to testbenching. If you want that information you should run each test individually.

### Important: 

All test files need to be inside "testCases" folder, if you want to add your own file put it there.
